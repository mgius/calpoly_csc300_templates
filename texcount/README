Script has been tested on vogon, and should run on any system with perl. 
If you are running Linux, you almost certainly have perl.

$ perl texcount.pl myTexFilename.tex

Original README
===============
TeXcount is a Perl script that counts the number of words in the 
text of LaTeX files. It has rules for handling most of the common 
macros and provides colour coded output indicating which parts have 
been counted. Go to
  http://folk.uio.no/einarro/Comp/texwordcount.html
for more information or to access the script online as a web service.

The package, i.e. the script and all accompanying files, is
distributed under the LaTeX Project Public License.
